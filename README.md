There are several platforms where you can create a website for your school project for free. Here are some great options:

Wix – A popular website builder with drag-and-drop functionality. It offers a free plan with limitations (such as displaying ads and using a Wix-branded domain). Great for beginners.

Weebly – Another user-friendly website builder with free plans. You can use templates and easily customize them for your project.

Google Sites – If you need something simple and easy to set up, Google Sites is a free option with integration with other Google services.

WordPress.com – The free plan on WordPress lets you create a website with a WordPress-branded domain. It's a little more flexible, but may require some learning if you want to customize beyond templates.

GitHub Pages – If you are familiar with HTML/CSS or want to learn, GitHub Pages lets you create static websites for free. It’s an excellent option if you want to showcase your coding skills.

Carrd – A simple tool for creating one-page websites. It’s free to use with some limitations on features, but great for simple, clean projects.

Neocities – A free platform for creating simple websites, offering more control over your project if you want to code it yourself.

Do any of these sound like they could work for your school project? Let me know if you'd like help getting started!
